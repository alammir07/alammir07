		<p id="p4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What's good you guys? You all know that Fitness and Health have been the foundation of my journey, they got me where I am today - Beerbiceps is all about that and more. I have always believed in Self-Growth. Determination towards a goal is the one constant I tend to rely upon. Throughout my journey of 5 years and more, I have learnt one thing - No matter where you are, what you do, always keep striving for more. And withstanding that, I am presenting another piece of my heart to y'all - The Beerbiceps Website. With content created and curated by me personally, I present to you, a compilation of Blogs, Vlogs, YouTube videos, Podcasts and much more. This website will have everything you want to know about your very own - Beerbiceps a.k.a Ranveer Allahbadia.</p>
